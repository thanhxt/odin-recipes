    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Chicken:</b>
            You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.
        </li>
        <li><b>Seasonings:</b>
            This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li><b>Flour:</b>
            All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.
        </li>
        <li><b>Egg:</b>
            An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.
        </li>
        <li><b>Panko:</b>
            Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.
        </li>
        <li><b>Oil:</b>
            Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.
        </li>
    </ul>
